# AnalyzeCoolDrawings

This was an entry for 01/12/19's Local Hack day, presented by nwPlus. 

Based on the day's theme of communication and diversity, this Slack bot allows members of a workspace to transcend language barriers via the sharing of doodles! 

Using Google's quickDraw and translation API, users can create and share newly created doodles. The contents of the doodles are interpreted by quickDraw's image classification and returns the result translated to a language of choice. By doing so, we hope to have provided a fun, albeit roundabout, way to share ideas between cultures
